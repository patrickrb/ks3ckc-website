# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the KS3CKC website, please email the team at security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly until a fix has been announced.

## Security Measures

The KS3CKC website implements several security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT tokens are used for authentication with a 30-day expiration
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Token expiration and cleanup
- Role-based access control through user authorizations

### Data Protection

- Environment variables validated through Zod schemas
- API keys stored securely (never in URLs)
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Database access through Prisma (parameterized queries)

### Web Security Headers

The application uses the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy: Restricts the sources of executable scripts
- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- X-XSS-Protection: Helps prevent XSS attacks
- Strict-Transport-Security: Enforces HTTPS (production only)
- Referrer-Policy: Controls what information is sent in the Referer header

### CORS Configuration

CORS is configured to restrict access to the API endpoints, allowing only specified origins.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

When working on this codebase, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input using Zod schemas or similar
2. **Authentication**: Use `protectedProcedure` for endpoints requiring authentication
3. **Authorization**: Use the appropriate authorization checks for protected resources
4. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to the repository, use environment variables
5. **API Keys**: Never include API keys in URLs, use headers instead
6. **Logging**: Don't log sensitive information like passwords or tokens
7. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
8. **Content Security Policy**: Be mindful of the CSP when adding new scripts or resources
9. **CSRF Protection**: Use appropriate measures against cross-site request forgery
10. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## OWASP Top 10 Mitigations

This application implements measures to protect against the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

1. **Broken Access Control**: Role-based authentication, consistent authorization checks
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Secure JWT implementation with expiration
3. **Injection**: Parameterized queries via Prisma, input validation with Zod
4. **Insecure Design**: Security-focused architecture and code review
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Strict security headers, environment validation
6. **Vulnerable Components**: Regular dependency updates (use `npm audit` regularly)
7. **Identification/Authentication Failures**: Rate limiting, secure token handling
8. **Software and Data Integrity**: Validated third-party integrations
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring**: Structured logging with appropriate levels
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery**: Validated external URLs and requests
